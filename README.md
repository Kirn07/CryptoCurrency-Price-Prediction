# 🪙 Cryptocurrency Price Prediction  

This project predicts cryptocurrency prices using **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** models. It leverages historical time-series data to forecast potential price movements and analyze market trends.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Collect and preprocess historical cryptocurrency data.  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with interactive visualizations.  
- Implement ML/DL/Time-Series models such as:  
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** – Deep learning for sequential data.  
  - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** – Classical statistical time-series model.  
  - **XGBoost** – Gradient boosting for high-performance predictions.  
- Compare models using performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R² score).  
- Visualize **actual vs. predicted prices** with graphs.
